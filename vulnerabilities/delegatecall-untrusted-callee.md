## Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee

`Delegatecall` is a special variant of a message call. It is almost identical to a regular message call except the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract and `msg.sender` and `msg.value` remain the same. Essentially, `delegatecall` delegates other contracts to modify the calling contract's storage.

Since `delegatecall` gives so much control over a contract, it's very important to only use this with trusted contracts such as your own. If the target address comes from user input, be sure to verify that it is a trusted contract.

### Example

Consider the following contracts where `delegatecall` is misused, leading to a vulnerability:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

contract Proxy {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function forward(address callee, bytes calldata _data) public {
        require(callee.delegatecall(_data), "Delegatecall failed");
    }
}

contract Target {
    address public owner;

    function pwn() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}

contract Attack {
    address public proxy;

    constructor(address _proxy) {
        proxy = _proxy;
    }

    function attack(address target) public {
        Proxy(proxy).forward(target, abi.encodeWithSignature("pwn()"));
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Proxy` contract uses `delegatecall` to forward any call it receives to an address provided by the user. The `Target` contract contains a call to the `pwn()` function that changes the owner of the contract to the caller.

The `Attack` contract takes advantage of this setup by calling the `forward` function of the `Proxy` contract, passing the address of the `Target` contract and the encoded function call `pwn()`. This results in the `Proxy` contract's storage being modified, specifically the `owner` variable, which is set to the attackerâ€™s address.

### Mitigations

To mitigate the risks associated with `delegatecall` to untrusted callees, consider the following strategies:

1. **Whitelist Trusted Contracts**: Ensure that the target address for `delegatecall` is a contract you control or a contract that is part of a verified and trusted list.

2. **Limit the Scope of Delegatecall**: Use `delegatecall` only for specific, controlled operations. Avoid exposing it as a general-purpose function unless absolutely necessary.
